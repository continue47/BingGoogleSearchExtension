# What it is and how it works

It's a simple extension that adds an option to the right click context menu to search with both Bing and Google at the same time in the same window, side by side. It uses HTML iframes to achieve this.

You can also set the extension URL as your default search engine so when you type something in the URL bar you can search with "Bing|Google" and get results from both.

### TLDR Install Guide:
* Open extension page in your browser (Tested on Edge and Chrome)
* Enable developer mode
* Load unpacked extension
* Select folder "BingGoogleSearch" (the one with manifest.json in it)


### Will add it on the Chrome extension store and Edge addon store soon so sideloading won't be needed.
